How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake.

Left Arrow: Move left
Up Arrow: Move up
Right Arrow: Move right
Down Arrow: Move down
The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible to increase your score and grow the snake longer.

Avoid hitting the boundaries of the game area or colliding with your own body or obstacles. Doing so will end the game.

Whenever you eat an apple:

Your score increases.
The snake grows longer.
Every 100 points, you progress to the next level, and new obstacles are generated.
Collecting lucky blocks grants additional points and increases the length of the snake.

Press the 'e' key to pause or resume the game.

Press the 'r' key to remove a segment from the snake, but it costs 2 points. Be careful not to have a negative score.

Use the "Dev" button to perform developer actions:

Add: Allows you to manually add points to your score.
Remove: Allows you to manually remove points from your score.
Lucky: Places a lucky block on the game area, granting extra points when collected.
Obstacle: Adds an obstacle to the game area.
